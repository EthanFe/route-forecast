<h1>Cycle Route Forecast</h1>
<p>Cycle Route Forecast integrates route and elevation data entered from  a GPX file or a Ride With GPS route number with a localized Dark Sky weather forecast for the chosen starting date and time and expected riding pace (mph, moving average), producing a route map and a detailed weather forecast for the route. </p>
<h3>Pace</h3>
<p>
Although distance and temperature in the weather display can be displayed in metric units (using the “metric” checkbox) riding pace must be selected in miles per hour.  You can convert with this table:
<p></p>
<table>
<tr><th>m/h</th><th>km/h</th></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>16.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>17.7</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>19.3</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>20.9</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>22.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>24.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>25.7</td></tr
><tr><td>17</td><td>27.4</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>29.0</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Weather Forecast</h3>
<p>Time, mileage along the route at that time, temperature, chance of rain, cloud cover and wind speed and direction are listed, along with expected finishing time and anticipated time lost due to wind.  Wind direction is also shown graphically on the route map.</p>
<p>Clicking on the temperature column heading switches between actual and apparent  temperature, and clicking on the wind speed column heading switches between sustained wind speed and gusts.</p>
<h3>Control Points</h3>
<p>Rest stops or control points along the route can be added in the Control Point List, along with the time expected to be spent at those stops. Expected arrival time at each control point and time remaining to stay within ACP/RUSA brevet finishing times are listed. Control points can be added in any order and sorted into proper sequence by clicking on the miles/km column header in the control point list.</p>
<h3>Post-ride Analysis</h3>
<p>A generated short URL lets the current settings be recreated, and Strava data uploaded by clicking on the “Powered by Strava” control after the ride will analyze how actual performance on the ride compared with the plan.</p>
<h3>Metric Units</h3>
<p>A metric checkbox toggles temperature between degrees F and C and distance between miles and km in the weather forecast, as well as setting distances for control points added to the control point list as either miles or kilometers.  However, as noted, regardless of the metric checkbox setting riding pace must be selected in mph,</p> 
<h3>Printing the Forecast</h3>
<p>The forecast and control point table can be printed – in landscape mode, portrait won't display all the data correctly – for use while riding the route.  It may be necessary to adjust the width of the screen sections and to use Print Preview to scale the size of the printed page to get everything to fit.</p>
<h3>Reporting Bugs</h3>
<p>A control is provided so that bug reports can be submitted on GitHub.</p>
